<h2>Censorship in U.S Media</h2>
<p>"The purpose of censorship is to change or stifle acts, thoughts or publications, which are seen as repulsive, harmful, politically unwanted or, for example, contrary to the interests of state officials."</p>
<p>While new technology allows for the free flow of information, it can also be manipulated by repressive governments to stifle free expression. Information technologies have only made censorship more complicated and strictly monitered. With the TRUMP administration for example, faced with a president who tweets frequently about “fake news,” U.S. journalists today feel more susceptible to censorship, as noted by Alan Huffman, a freelance journalist. Additionally, during the 2020 presidential election social media platforms were the pinnacle of the citizen's decisions and news sources.

<h2>Propaganda in U.S Media</h2>
<p>"In a world before social media and the internet, how did the United States encourage and promote American citizens in the 1930s and 1940s to contribute to the war effort? The answer-propaganda and lots of it." - Rob Price</p>
<p>All around us the internet and social media platforms have a way of persuading the human mind into seeing what's trending and like all human traits we are prone to follow what society shows us. In today's world problems as we all know one of the most known country to use different forms of propaganda is, China. <i>And how might that affect the U.S?</i> Well, credibility is for one misguided and news outlets all showcase different statistics as well as news that they want to showcase their audience. American journalists must work harder to get concrete information and not fall unto propaganda hands.
